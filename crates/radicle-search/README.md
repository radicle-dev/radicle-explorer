# radicle-search

Optional indexing daemon for Radicle. Runs alongside `radicle-node` and
maintains a Meilisearch index of repo metadata that `radicle-httpd` can
use to serve fast, typo-tolerant repo listings and full-text search.

When configured, httpd routes `/repos?sort=activity|seeding` and
`/repos/search?q=…` through the index. When absent or unreachable, httpd
transparently falls back to its built-in storage walk — no configuration
on the client side, no API contract changes.

## What each repository document contains

The daemon writes one Meilisearch document per repository. Within it, fields
play different roles — only the searchable ones are "indexed" in the full-text
sense:

- **Searchable** (matched by `/repos/search?q=…`): `name`, `description`.
- **Sortable** (ordering for `/repos?sort=…`): `seedingCount` (most-seeded) and
  `headCommitterTime` (recently-active).
- **Filterable**: `delegates`, `visibility`.
- **Stored** — held on the document but not searched, sorted, or filtered:
  `rid`, head OID, and default branch.

httpd uses the index to resolve a sorted or matched set of `rid`s, then builds
each repo's response (including its activity sparkline) from storage.

Only public repos this node seeds are indexed.

## How it stays up to date

1. **Bootstrap.** On startup and after every event-stream reconnect, the
   daemon walks the storage tree end-to-end and re-upserts everything.
2. **Real time.** Subscribes to the node's control socket (same stream as
   `rad node events`) and reacts to:
   - `RefsFetched`, `LocalRefsAnnounced`, `CanonicalRefUpdated`, `RefsSynced`
     → re-index the affected repo.
   - `SeedDiscovered`, `SeedDropped`, `RefsAnnounced` → re-index only if
     the rid is one we locally seed (filtered against an in-memory cache,
     so gossip about repos we don't host is dropped at near-zero cost).
3. **Periodic rescan.** Every `RADICLE_SEARCH_RESCAN_SECS` (default 1h)
   as a safety net for missed events.

## Setup

### 1. Install Meilisearch

Follow the official installation guide:
<https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/getting_started/installation>

The simplest path on Linux is the install script:

```sh
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
```

This drops a single self-contained `meilisearch` binary in the current
directory. Move it onto your `$PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin/`).

Run it:

```sh
meilisearch \
  --http-addr 127.0.0.1:7700 \
  --db-path ~/.meilisearch/data \
  --no-analytics
```

For production set a master key with `--master-key <KEY>` and run with
`--env production`; see the Meilisearch docs for hardening guidance.

### 2. Build and run radicle-search

`radicle-search` is a member of the Cargo workspace rooted at the
repository root (it lives under `crates/`), so build it from there. Cargo
places the binary in the workspace-wide `target/`, not under this crate's
directory:

```sh
cargo build --release -p radicle-search
./target/release/radicle-search
```

The daemon picks up the Radicle profile from `RAD_HOME` and the node
control socket from `RAD_SOCKET` (or their defaults). On first launch it
bootstraps the index in a few seconds, then listens for node events.

### 3. Point httpd at the index

Set `RADICLE_SEARCH_URL` (plus optional friends) before launching httpd:

```sh
RADICLE_SEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7700 radicle-httpd
```

On boot httpd logs `search backend enabled: url=… index=repos`. With the
env var absent, httpd works exactly as before.

## Configuration

All via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_MEILI_URL` | `http://localhost:7700` | Meilisearch instance to connect to. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_MEILI_KEY` | _(none)_ | Meilisearch master key (production mode). |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` | `repos` | Index name this daemon maintains. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_RESCAN_SECS` | `3600` | Interval between safety-net full rescans. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_RECONNECT_BACKOFF_SECS` | `5` | Delay before reconnecting after an event-stream disconnect. |
| `RAD_HOME` | `~/.radicle` | Standard Radicle profile path. |
| `RAD_SOCKET` | `$RAD_HOME/node/control.sock` | Standard node control socket. |

httpd reads a parallel set to decide, at runtime, whether to use the index:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_URL` | _(none)_ | Meilisearch instance httpd queries. **Unset disables search** — httpd serves listings and search from its storage walk. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_KEY` | _(none)_ | Meilisearch API key. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` | `repos` | Index name to query. |
| `RADICLE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `500` | Per-query timeout in milliseconds (must be a non-zero integer). |

Use the same URL/key/index values in both processes. A single
`radicle-httpd` binary handles both modes — no build-time feature flag is
involved. When `RADICLE_SEARCH_URL` is unset, or when a query to the
backend fails or times out, httpd transparently falls back to the storage
walk, so the API behaves identically either way.
